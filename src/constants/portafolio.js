I wrote a general template that rendered the information fetching it from the address id and comparing it to my constant object. Therefore to load each of the pages I only had to use a Hook in charge of the rendering process.

Although the projects are simple, they do not lack complexity in the needs of each application. Mainly the calculator and the HTML Markdown Previewer (for the second, I used a github library when generating the markdown). While the course in JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures allowed me to really specify my knowledge in JavaScript through the different modules: ES6, REGEX, Data Structures, Algorithm Scripting, Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming. However, what I enjoyed the most about the course were the more than 20 algorithms that I had to solve to get the certificate. I loved!",
