The search parameters are refined using different array methods.In summary: the website allowed me to delve into the use of APIs, how they interact with data, and hone my skills in a responsive design.",

I wrote a general template that rendered the information fetching it from the address id and comparing it to my constant object. Therefore to load each of the pages I only had to use a Hook in charge of the rendering process.
